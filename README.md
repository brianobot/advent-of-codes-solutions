# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains personal solutions to various "Advent of Code" challenges. The Advent of Code is an annual event featuring a series of programming puzzles that get progressively more challenging. The aim is to provide an opportunity to practice coding skills in a fun and festive manner.

## Contents

- **2024**: Solutions for Challenges for the Year 2024
- **2025**: Solutions for Challenges for the year 2025 


## How to Use

Each solution reads input from a corresponding file located in the `<year>/data/` directory, such as `day_1_input.txt` or `day_2_input.txt`. Ensure that these input files are correctly placed before running the programs.

### Running the Solutions

- **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. Run the solutions using:
  ```bash
  python 2025/day_1.py
  python 2025/day_2.py
  ```
  
- **Rust**: Have Rust installed and use:
  ```bash
  cargo run --bin day_1
  cargo run --bin day_2
  ```
  
## Note
This repository acts as a personal log of solutions and may contain custom logic suited to the input format I anticipated for these challenges. Adjustments might be necessary to adapt to different or official input formats as distributed in the event.
